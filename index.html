       <div class="topic">Web Devlopment</div>
       <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications using a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and tools. It involves several stages, including designing the user interface, creating the functionality and interactivity of the site, and deploying it to a web server.

Web development typically involves working with three primary languages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. HTML is used to create the structure and content of web pages, while CSS is used to style and layout those pages. JavaScript is used to create interactive elements and dynamic functionality, such as drop-down menus, pop-up notifications, and animations.

Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end and back-end development.</p>

       <div class="topic">Graphic Design</div>
       <p>Graphic design is the art and practice of creating visual content to communicate information or ideas to a specific audience. It involves combining typography, images, illustrations, and other elements to create designs that are visually appealing and effective in communicating a message or concept.

Graphic designers use various tools and software, such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, to create their designs. They often work with clients to understand their goals and develop a design concept that meets their needs. 
         They may also collaborate with other professionals, such as writers, marketers, and web developers, to create cohesive branding and marketing campaigns.</p>

       <p>Photography is the art and practice of capturing and creating images using a camera. The term "photography" comes from the Greek words "phos" meaning light and "graph√©" meaning drawing or writing.

Photography has a rich history, dating back to the 19th century with the invention of the first camera. Today, photography has become more accessible than ever before, with the rise of digital cameras, smartphones, and social media platforms that allow users to share their photos with a global audience.</p>

Native apps are developed specifically for a particular platform, such as iOS or Android, and can take full advantage of the device's hardware and software capabilities. Web apps are developed using web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and run within a mobile web browser.</p>
